A WordPress plugin to create social share links and sets

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy for users to generate social profile sets and sharing links but also makes it simple for the developer to implement into a template. Whether Socializr is used as a shortcode or it used in a template. You will not be disappointed with how it performs.


Basic steps:

1. Create a set, add social profiles or select social networks that the post can be shared on.
2. go in the template and call socializr('handle') to return as an array or socializr('handle', true)
Alternatively you can use the shortcode in your post like so [socializr handle="handle"] which is the equivelant to socializr('handle', true)

Prettier styles and full documentation coming soon.
